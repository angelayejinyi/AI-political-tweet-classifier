# 2024 U.S. Election AIGC Dataset

The **2024 U.S. Election AIGC Dataset** is designed for detecting AI-generated political tweets. The dataset focuses on distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated tweets, specifically in the context of the U.S. elections. It leverages a combination of tweets generated by four leading AI models and human-written tweets sampled from a pre-ChatGPT era dataset.

## AIGC Text Dataset Overview

The dataset is constructed based on the methodology introduced in Dmonte et al. (2024) and further refined using prompts as suggested by Cinus et al. (2025). It includes:
- **Human-Written Tweets:** Randomly sampled from a dataset related to the 2020 U.S. Election (Chen, Deb, and Ferrara 2022), ensuring the texts predate widespread large language model (LLM) usage.
- **AI-Generated Tweets:** For each human-written tweet, an AI-generated counterpart is created using the following prompt:
  > *"This is a tweet related to the 2020 U.S. election: {tweet}. Based on the topic of the given tweet, write a new tweet, mimicking the language styles used by Twitter users."*

The AI-generated tweets are produced using four different models:
- GPT-4o
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Gemini 1.5
- Llama 3 8B

This dataset is split into training and testing sets and is suitable for binary classification tasks to detect whether a tweet is human-written or AI-generated.
**The dataset is located in the `text_dataset` folder. The train and test datasets are in `train.csv` and `test.csv`, respectively. Human and AI-generated tweet pairs for each LLM (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, and Llama 3 8B) can be found in the `human_ai_tweet_pairs` folder under the `text_dataset` folder.**


### Model Training

A RoBERTa model is fine-tuned to classify tweets as human-written or AI-generated. Key training details include:
- **Optimizer:** AdamW
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-5
- **Epochs:** 3
- **Performance:** The model achieved an F1-score of 0.96 on the validation set.

To train the model, simply run the following command:

```bash
python train.py

# 2024 US Election AIGC Dataset

The **2024election AIGC Dataset** is designed for detecting AI-generated political tweets. The dataset focuses on distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated tweets, specifically in the context of the U.S. elections. It leverages a combination of tweets generated by four leading AI models and human-written tweets sampled from a pre-ChatGPT era dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is constructed based on the methodology introduced in Dmonte et al. (2024) and further refined using prompts as suggested by Cinus et al. (2025). It includes:
- **Human-Written Tweets:** Randomly sampled from a dataset related to the 2020 U.S. Election (Chen, Deb, and Ferrara 2022), ensuring the texts predate widespread large language model (LLM) usage.
- **AI-Generated Tweets:** For each human-written tweet, an AI-generated counterpart is created using the following prompt:
  > *"This is a tweet related to the 2020 U.S. election: {tweet}. Based on the topic of the given tweet, write a new tweet, mimicking the language styles used by Twitter users."*

The AI-generated tweets are produced using four different models:
- GPT-4o
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Gemini 1.5
- Llama 3 8B

This dataset is split into training and testing sets and is suitable for binary classification tasks to detect whether a tweet is human-written or AI-generated.

## Repository Structure


## Model Training

A RoBERTa model is fine-tuned to classify tweets as human-written or AI-generated. Key training details include:
- **Optimizer:** AdamW
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-5
- **Epochs:** 3
- **Performance:** The model achieved an F1-score of 0.96 on the validation set.

To train the model, simply run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
